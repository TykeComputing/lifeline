**** Class naming ****
All lower case with underscores except for acronyms which will be uppercase.

**** Variable naming ****
See "Class naming"

**** Constructor/Destructor usage ****
Prefer using constructors/destructors vs initialize/terminate (or other similar member function
scheme). If a constructor fails, throw a fatal_construction_exception if the failure is non-
recoverable. Otherwise throw an appropriate exception.
