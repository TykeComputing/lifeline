Lifeline (WORKING TITLE)
=============

Synopsis
-------------
Lifeline will be a 2D game and engine. What exactly the game will be is undecided at this point.

Goals
-------------
1. Gain experience in subjects I haven't gotten to spend much time on in [the other projects I've worked on](http://www.peterclark.net).
2. Practice game development, with an emphasis on rapidly iterating and building only what is needed when it is needed.
3. (Stretch) Create a game that I would want to play and ship it.

It should be noted that these goals will likely conflict with eachother from time to time. For example, I'd like to practice multi-threading, perhaps by having a dedicated rendering thread. This will likely prove unneccesary for a small 2D game (contradicting point 2), but would be educational for me (going along with point 1).
