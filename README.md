Lifeline (WORKING TITLE)
=============

Synopsis
-------------
Lifeline will be a 2D game and engine. What exactly the game will be is undecided at this point but once possible it will be rapidly prototyped and iterated on in engine.

Goals
-------------
* Practice game development, with an emphasis on rapidly iterating and building only what is needed when it is needed.
* Gain experience in subjects I haven't gotten to spend much time on in [the other projects I've worked on](http://www.peterclark.net).
* (Stretch) Create a game that I would want to play and ship it.
